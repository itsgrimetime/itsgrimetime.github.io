  <div class="entry-content"><p>So since I left Escanaba I have been staying with friends in Iron Mountain, Iron River, Houghton, and all down the coast of Lake Michigan (Wisconsin side).</p>

<p>On previous posts I was just putting the images directly in the post, which was bad because a lot of those pictures were huge (some of the panoramas are something like 10-12MB) Obviously this means when you open up the main page of the website, you have to load every single picture I&rsquo;ve taken. On slow connections this could take forever, and it could be devastating if you don&rsquo;t have an unlimited data plan on your phone and loaded up the site on mobile. After trying to find some other templates and image gallery plugins I opted for just embedding the imgur album at the end of each post. I&rsquo;ve
done this with all past posts as well.</p>

<p>I waited to long to start writing this so its going to be kind of hard to remember all the things that have happened since I last posted. My plan is to just post small chunks of the trip up until now.</p>

<p>Not a lot worth noting happened on the ride to Iron River. I got to see some of the cool old buildings, including the courthouse in Crystal Falls, and the large catholic church I used to live next to in Iron Mountain.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s weird to think I&rsquo;ve been in the UP for almost a week already. So far it&rsquo;s been pretty slow going along US-2, with lots of stop for rest and waiting out some rain.</p>

<p>When I left Straits State Park, right next to the bridge, I expected to make it close to Naubinway, at least. I don&rsquo;t know what it was, but riding was just really tiring that day, and I only made it to Brevort where I caved after having lunch and called it a day.</p>

<p>The next morning I felt pretty good, and was ready to make some real distance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I caught a bit of rain only a few minutes before I passed through Epoufette, and of course, I was optimistic and thought it would stop&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, it didn&rsquo;t I ended up riding in the rain for about another hour, before finally getting to the campground I had planned on getting to the previous day. I set up my hammock and rainfly and decided to wait things out and warm up a bit. I considered staying until the next morning to dry some of my stuff out since the forecast had mentioned sunny and 70, and everything I had was soaked through completely.</p>

<p>I napped for a bit and around 5ish the sun came back out, and it warmed up enough for me to feel alright wearing sandals on the bike while I strapped my soaking wet shoes onto the back to try and help them air dry.</p>

<p>It was a pretty nice ride the rest of the evening to Lake Milakokia, but holy crap were the mosquitos crazy. I woke up to half a dozen of them in my bugnet with me, and what had to be hundreds crawling around outside of it.</p>

<p>In Escanaba I ended up staying with a host from <a href="http://warmshowers.org">Warm Showers</a>, a couch-surfing type of site aimed towards cyclists.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have more pictures soon!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, so I got a ride into town and was able to drop my bike off at <a href="http://revolutionbandb.webs.com/">Revolution Bike &amp; Boards</a> here in Charlevoix, MI. Holy crap were these guys cool. Not only were they open on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, but they also offered to try and look at it the same day, and get me back on the road.</p>

<p>I hung around Charlevoix for a few hours, when I got a call back from the owner, Chet, who said things were good to go. I got back over to the shop, and he explained that the hub on my current rear wheel had gotten a bit too much dirt and sand in it, and it was starting to wear away. A new rear wheel set me back about 80$, but I obviously didn&rsquo;t have much of a choice. Afterwards, I talked with Chet for a little bit about my trip and headed back south on 31 for about a mile to the place I was camping for the night.</p>

<p>So the other day, when I was picked up on the side of the road with my broken down bike, the guy who gave me the ride offered to let me camp on the property he owned behind his used car dealership here in Charlevoix.</p>

<p>It was about 5:00pm or so when I got back and was looking like there was going to be some rain coming, so I set up and napped a bit before heading out to try and find some power/wifi.</p>

<p>It rained quite a bit that night, and it kept me up at times with how loud it was, but it was a comfortable night nonetheless.</p>

<p>I woke up to a drizzly morning, but it was pretty warm out. I got packed up and started my way back up 31 towards Petoskey/Mackinac City.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lets see, its been a while, so this is going to be a big post.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s ride went really well. I ended up getting up a few hours before I normally have been since I started this trip (7:30am vs 10:30am), and used the extra time to wash some clothes, sit and eat breakfast, and write the previous posts.</p>

<p>After the cold windy weather that I&rsquo;ve been riding through the last few days, the 60 degree sun with little wind felt amazing. I ended up making really great time and did the 48 miles to the campground just east of Buelah in just under 4 hours.</p>

<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much excitement on the road today, except for a short (and fast) moment. While taking Big Four north (the longest stretch of the ride) I biked past a house with an unleashed dog.. Now, thankfully from my practice ride up to Newaygo last week, I learned to watch for dogs, and to be ready to have to outrun one if need be.</p>

<p>Well, I was riding up, and I saw a man driving his truck up to a barn, with a dog bouncing around in front of him. I was careful not to shift gears as to make too much noise, at least until I was past the house and sure I&rsquo;d have a head start on the beast. Once the man stopped driving, he got out of his car, and we made eye contact. I raised my hand to wave, as did he. At this point I was positive his dog was pretty well trained or uninterested, and turned my head to look in front of me again. As soon as I do, I hear a bark, and the man yell &ldquo;No! Don&rsquo;t you run after him!&rdquo;. I immediately start
cranking away as I look back to see how fast the dog is gaining on me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a big dog, a rotweiler-and-something mix, I&rsquo;m pretty sure, and it&rsquo;s fast. Now at this point some friends of mine would say &ldquo;Oh Mike, he just wants to come say hi!&rdquo; Well, the way it was running at me did not look that way. For all I know the dog just sees a giant friggen turkey drumstick on a bike.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pedalling at full power and am hesitant to look back; half because doing so with a load on the bike is dangerous at high speeds, and half because I don&rsquo;t want to see if it&rsquo;s any closer. Now, the dog I encountered in Newaygo definitely had me pedalling, but it gave up fairly quickly compared to this one. It just <em>kept</em> running. I keep cranking away, finally reaching my highest gear. My thighs are on fire. Just as I begin to fear that the dog might out-endure me, I take a look back and see that it&rsquo;s slowed to a gallop. By this point the man is running after the dog, and were easily a couple
football fields away from his driveway where I caught the dog&rsquo;s attention.</p>

<p>So, all in all, I may owe my good time to the dog. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - it&rsquo;s a little fun after the fact, knowing that I&rsquo;ve escaped, but seeing that dog barrelling after you is not pleasant in the slightest. I&rsquo;m not really familiar with how fast different dogs can run, but I do know that if I see someone with a greyhound I&rsquo;m just going to get off my bike and lie on the ground.</p>

<p>Next morning, I got up pretty early again and was packed up and on the road again by 10:30. Not a lot of pictures of the ride this time, as I knew I had a long ways to go to get to Leelanau State Park.</p>

<p>I made it to TC by about 1, and stopped at a grocery store to buy some food and grab lunch.</p>

<p>The rest of the ride up to Leelanau State park was tough. I was pretty beat even after getting to TC, and then having to do another 37 miles was not something I was super excited for, especially in another headwind. I took it slow, and made it to the campground just after 8pm, in time to set up and catch a bit of the sunset!</p>

<p>Leelanau State park has by far been the most beautiful park I&rsquo;ve been to yet. Best part was that it wasn&rsquo;t even that full. I really expected it to be packed with it being memorial day weekend, but it appears that some people are afraid of the cold :).</p>

<p>Google Plus has a feature where it&rsquo;ll &ldquo;enhance&rdquo; pictures you take, based on some algorithm they have. In general I like what it does with most pictures, but sometimes it&rsquo;ll overdo it and they&rsquo;ll come out kind of awkward. Not this time, I really liked what it did with the sunset picture:</p>

<p>Since there&rsquo;s a single route from Northport to the statepark, a lot of other campers passed me on the highway. I got  couple encouraging honks and cheers, and ended up meeting some people at the park that night. Funny enough, they were from the GR area too, and were just getting ready to leave for a long(er) bike trip, from Maine to the tip of Argentina! I hung out for a bit, and then crashed pretty early. They were so cool as to bring me some of the breakfast they cooked the next morning, too!</p>

<p>That night was probably one of the coldest temperature-wise so far, but I played around with my set up a bit and found that putting my sleeping bag inside the fleece liner as opposed to the other way around keeps it much warmer at night. It was probably one of the most comfortable nights I&rsquo;ve had so far.</p>

<p>So after a great nights sleep I got up to a beautiful morning, took my time packing up and enjoying the sunlight, and ended up riding back to Northport with the people I&rsquo;d met the night before. After exchanging information we parted ways, and I made my way back towards TC.</p>

<p>It was hot, which was nice, but I was going into another strong headwind the entire way down the peninsula. It&rsquo;s funny, I&rsquo;d swear that when I&rsquo;m on my bike I&rsquo;m in control of the weather. I can&rsquo;t think of a time I&rsquo;ve had a tailwind the entire trip, it always seems to be blowing the opposite way that I&rsquo;m going.</p>

<p>Once I made it to TC I stopped, grabbed some water, and figured out where I was headed to next. I had grabbed an AirBnb for the night just south of Charlevoix, so I still had quite a ride from Traverse City to get there, and it was already going on 5pm.</p>

<p>Another 40 miles? Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>

<p>No more headwind! Riding was going well, and I was on track to make it to the AirBnb by 9ish or so..</p>

<p>Just outside of Elk Rapids my bike started making a lot more noise than usual. Not good noise, either. I stopped a few times to try and check it out, and it&rsquo;d go away for a bit, then come back. Finally I just flipped it upside down on the side of the highway and started really trying to dig into it to see what was up. My cassette was wobbling a bit too much and making some pretty nasty grinding noises. I undid the quick release on the back wheel to try and diagnose it further but wasn&rsquo;t able to figure anything else out. Perhaps a ball bearing was ground down somehow? I don&rsquo;t know how else the cassette would wobble and grind so much.</p>

<p>I was starting to realize that its probably not good to ride on it anymore, when someone stopped and asked if I needed help. Neither of us were bike tech&rsquo;s, so his guess was as good as mine - but he was nice enough to offer to drive me the last 15 miles or so to where I was staying.</p>

<p>So now I&rsquo;m here, and it&rsquo;s the next morning. Apparently there&rsquo;s a nice bike shop in Charlevoix, but I&rsquo;m not positive they&rsquo;re open today. Hopefully I can get the bike back into riding shape sometime within the next two days. Until then, looks like I&rsquo;m hanging out in Charlevoix.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was pretty cold again last night, but it looks like the weather is going to be warming up for the next few days.</p>

<p>It was really warm in the morning, but as soon as I got back into Mears and out on the highway it seemed like the temperature dropped 15 degrees, and the wind kicked up another 10 miles per hour&hellip;</p>

<p>Nothing super interesting today. I came across some old churches which I thought looked really cool.</p>

<p>While I was at the Burger King here in Manistee using the internet, an older couple struck up conversation with me after noticing I was riding my bike. After being told to make sure I wear my long-johns and to look out for bears, they asked if they could take a picture of me. I figured why not, and asked for them to take one with my camera too.</p>

<p>I got to the campground and there were no sites with trees close enough for me to set up my hammock.. so I had to roam around a bit and rig something up between these two birches.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I dont remember a lot of this ride already, (its curretly day 3, time on the bike is starting to blend together in my head).</p>

<p>The Musketawa trail is a 25-mile paved trail that connects Marne and Muskegon, MI.</p>

<p>Overall it was a nice ride. It was really warm, which was great, but I was going into a ~15mph headwind most of the way when there wasn&rsquo;t tree cover. I was pretty beat by the end of the day.</p>

<p>The park I was at was almost empty, which was pretty cool.</p>

<p>What I thought was going to be a short ride (only ~35 miles compared to the ~45 I did the day before) turned out to be a much more frustrating and tiring day.</p>

<p>It was really cold, somewhere around 45 degrees, and again I was going into a really strong headwind. I was dumb and didn&rsquo;t pack much in terms of cold weather gear, so I was stuck pedaling with shorts and a long-sleeve tshirt for the first while.</p>

<p>Just before I got to Whitehall, I had my first flat.</p>

<p>It took me a while to fix because of the cold, so I didn&rsquo;t even get into Whitehall/Montague until around 1:00pm.</p>

<p>On the way out of Whitehall I stopped at a clothing surplus store to grab an extra hoodie and sweatpants. I guarantee you - I look really cool now.</p>

<p>The extra layers helped a bit, but it was still cold riding. It felt like it took so much just to get myself to maintain a decent speed on the trail.</p>

<p>Silver Lake State Park was beautiful, and I was able to catch an awesome sunset over the dunes across Silver Lake.</p>

<p>After my (cold) night at Silver Lake I left around 11:00am for Orchard Beach State Park, just north of Manistee. Should have a post and pictures for that up tomorrow :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to take the set-up out for a trial-run at least once before embarking on the full trip. I&rsquo;ve taken it out fully loaded for two separate 20ish mile rides and it rode pretty well, but I wanted to see if there were any kinks in the whole ride-camp-ride process that needed to be worked out before leaving for the big ride.</p>

<p>I ended up deciding Newaygo State Park was a good distance (~40 miles). It also allowed me to ride a bit on both paved and dirt roads as well as paved and gravel trails.</p>

<p>Overall, the ride up wasn&rsquo;t bad. Riding on some of the county roads was a little scary at first, since people speed like crazy down them.</p>

<p>Departure is scheduled for Monday the 18th, and Muskegon State Park is the first destination (~48 miles). I&rsquo;m getting stoked!</p>

<p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s some random pictures from throughout the day.</p>
