Lets see, its been a while, so this is going to be a big post.

Today's ride went really well. I ended up getting up a few hours before I normally have been since I started this trip (7:30am vs 10:30am), and used the extra time to wash some clothes, sit and eat breakfast, and write the previous posts.

After the cold windy weather that I've been riding through the last few days, the 60 degree sun with little wind felt amazing. I ended up making really great time and did the 48 miles to the campground just east of Buelah in just under 4 hours.

There wasn't much excitement on the road today, except for a short (and fast) moment. While taking Big Four north (the longest stretch of the ride) I biked past a house with an unleashed dog.. Now, thankfully from my practice ride up to Newaygo last week, I learned to watch for dogs, and to be ready to have to outrun one if need be.

Well, I was riding up, and I saw a man driving his truck up to a barn, with a dog bouncing around in front of him. I was careful not to shift gears as to make too much noise, at least until I was past the house and sure I'd have a head start on the beast. Once the man stopped driving, he got out of his car, and we made eye contact. I raised my hand to wave, as did he. At this point I was positive his dog was pretty well trained or uninterested, and turned my head to look in front of me again. As soon as I do, I hear a bark, and the man yell "No! Don't you run after him!". I immediately start
cranking away as I look back to see how fast the dog is gaining on me.

It's a big dog, a rotweiler-and-something mix, I'm pretty sure, and it's fast. Now at this point some friends of mine would say "Oh Mike, he just wants to come say hi!" Well, the way it was running at me did not that way. For all I know the dog just sees a giant friggen turkey drumstick on a bike.

I'm pedalling at full power and am hesitant to look back; half because doing so with a load on the bike is dangerous at high speeds, and half because I don't want to see if it's any closer. Now, the dog I encountered in Newaygo definitely had me pedalling, but it gave up fairly quickly compared to this one. It just *kept* running. I keep cranking away, finally reaching my highest gear. My thighs are on fire. Just as I begin to fear that the dog might out-endure me, I take a look back and see that it's slowed to a gallop. By this point the man is running after the dog, and were easily a couple
football fields away from his driveway where I caught the dog's attention.

So, all in all, I may owe my good time to the dog. Don't get me wrong - it's a little fun after the fact, knowing that I've escaped, but seeing that dog barrelling after you is not pleasant in the slightest. I'm not really familiar with how fast different dogs can run, but I do know that if I see someone with a greyhound I'm just going to get off my bike and lie on the ground.

Next morning, I got up pretty early again and was packed up and on the road again by 10:30. Not a lot of pictures of the ride this time, as I knew I had a long ways to go to get to Leelanau State Park.

I made it to TC by about 1, and stopped at a grocery store to buy some food and grab lunch.

The rest of the ride up to Leelanau State park was tough. I was pretty beat even after getting to TC, and then having to do another 37 miles was not something I was super excited for, especially in another headwind. I took it slow, and made it to the campground just after 8pm, in time to set up and catch a bit of the sunset!

Leelanau State park has by far been the most beautiful parkI've been to yet. Best part was that it wasn't even that full. I really expected it to be packed with it being memorial day weekend, but it appears that some people are afraid of the cold :).

Google Plus has a feature where it'll "enhance" pictures you take, based on some algorithm they have. In general I like what it does with most pictures, but sometimes it'll overdo it and they'll come out kind of awkward. Not this time, I really liked what it did with the sunset picture:

Since there's a single route from Northport to the statepark, a lot of other campers passed me on the highway. I got  couple encouraging honks and cheers, and ended up meeting some people at the park that night. Funny enough, they were from the GR area too, and were just getting ready to leave for a long(er) bike trip, from Maine to the tip of Argentina! I hung out for a bit, and then crashed pretty early. They were so cool as to bring me some of the breakfast they cooked the next morning, too!

That night was probably one of the coldest temperature-wise so far, but I played around with my set up a bit and found that putting my sleeping bag inside the fleece liner as opposed to the other way around keeps it much warmer at night. It was probably one of the most comfortable nights I've had so far.

So after a great nights sleep I got up to a beautiful morning, took my time packing up and enjoying the sunlight, and ended up riding back to Northport with the people I'd met the night before. After exchanging information we parted ways, and I made my way back towards TC.

It was hot, which was nice, but I was going into another strong headwind the entire way down the peninsula. It's funny, I'd swear that when I'm on my bike I'm in control of the weather. I can't think of a time I've had a tailwind the entire trip, it always seems to be blowing the opposite way that I'm going.

Once I made it to TC I stopped, grabbed some water, and figured out where I was headed to next. I had grabbed an AirBnb for the night just south of Charlevoix, so I still had quite a ride from Traverse City to get there, and it was already going on 5pm.

Another 40 miles? Let's do it.

No more headwind! Riding was going well, and I was on track to make it to the AirBnb by 9ish or so..

Just outside of Elk Rapids my bike started making a lot more noise than usual. Not good noise, either. I stopped a few times to try and check it out, and it'd go away for a bit, then come back. Finally I just flipped it upside down on the side of the highway and started really trying to dig into it to see what was up. My cassette was wobbling a bit too much and making some pretty nasty grinding noises. I undid the quick release on the back wheel to try and diagnose it further but wasn't able to figure anything else out. Perhaps a ball bearing was ground down somehow? I don't know how else the cassette would wobble and grind so much.

I was starting to realize that its probably not good to ride on it anymore, when someone stopped and asked if I needed help. Neither of us were bike tech's, so his guess was as good as mine, but he was nice enough to offer to drive me the last 15 miles or so to where I was staying.

So now I'm here, it's the next morning. Apparently there's a nice bike shop in Charlevoix, but I'm not positive they're open today. Hopefully I can get the bike back into riding shape sometime within the next two days. Until then, looks like I'm hanging out in Charlevoix..
