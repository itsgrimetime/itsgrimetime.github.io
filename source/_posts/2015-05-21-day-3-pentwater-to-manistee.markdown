It was pretty cold again last night, but it looks like the weather is going to be warming up for the next few days.

It was really warm in the morning, but as soon as I got back into Mears and out on the highway it seemed like the temperature dropped 15 degrees, and the wind kicked up another 10 miles per hour...

Nothing super interesting today. I came across some old churches which I thought looked really cool.

While I was at the Burger King here in Manistee using the internet, an older couple struck up conversation with me after noticing I was riding my bike. After being told to make sure I wear my long-johns and to look out for bears, they asked if they could take a picture of me. I figured why not, and asked for them to take one with my camera too.


I got to the campground and there were no sites with trees close enough for me to set up my hammock.. so I had to roam around a bit and rig something up between these two birches.
