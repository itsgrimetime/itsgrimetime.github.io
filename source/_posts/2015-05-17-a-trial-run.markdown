I wanted to take the set-up out for a trial-run at least once before embarking on the full trip. I've taken it out fully loaded for two separate 20ish mile rides and it rode pretty well, but I wanted to see if there were any kinks in the whole ride-camp-ride process that needed to be worked out before leaving for the big ride.

I ended up deciding Newaygo State Park was a good distance (~40 miles). It also allowed me to ride a bit on both paved and dirt roads as well as paved and gravel trails.

Overall, the ride up wasn't bad. Riding on some of the county roads was a little scary at first, since people speed like crazy down them.

Departure is scheduled for Monday the 18th, and Muskegon State Park is the first destination (~48 miles). I'm getting stoked!

Oh, and here's some random pictures from throughout the day (the popout isn't working, so if you want to see a bigger version of a picture just right click and 'Open Image in New Tab').
