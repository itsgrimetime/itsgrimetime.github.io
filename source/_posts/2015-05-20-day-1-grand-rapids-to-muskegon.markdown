(Not all of my images are uploaded yet, so I'll be updating this again with more pictures.)

I dont remember a lot of this ride already, (its curretly day 3, time on the bike is starting to blend together in my head).

The Musketawa trail is a 25-mile paved trail that connects Marne and Muskegon, MI.

Overall it was a nice ride. It was really warm, which was great, but I was going into a ~15mph headwind most of the way when there wasn't tree cover. I was pretty beat by the end of the day.

The park I was at was almost empty, which was pretty cool.

What I thought was going to be a short ride (only ~35 miles compared to the ~45 I did the day before) turned out to be a much more frustrating and tiring day.

It was really cold, somewhere around 45 degrees, and again I was going into a really strong headwind. I was dumb and didn't pack much in terms of cold weather gear, so I was stuck pedaling with shorts and a long-sleeve tshirt for the first while.

Just before I got to Whitehall, I had my first flat. It took me a while to fix because of the cold, so I didn't even get into Whitehall/Montague until around 1:00pm.

On the way out of Whitehall I stopped at a clothing surplus store to grab an extra hoodie and sweatpants. I guarantee you - I look really cool now.

The extra layers helped a bit, but it was still cold riding. It felt like it took so much just to get myself to maintain a decent speed on the trail.

Silver Lake State Park was beautiful, and I was able to catch an awesome sunset over the dunes across Silver Lake. Those pictures will be up soon.

I don't want to spend too much time doing this right now, as I'm still ~25 miles away from Orchard Beach State Park and its almost 5:00pm already. Maybe I'll have internet and some time to work on this tomorrow.
