So here is a *really* **really** rough itinerary I sketched up like 12 hours before I left. It's very possible I don't actually go to any of these places.The mile counts weren't updated after I've changed some of the locations so its only sort of accurate. Drop me a line on Facebook or through email if I'm coming through/near your city/town/village/pile of dirt.
