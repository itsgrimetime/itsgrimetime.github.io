Okay, so I got a ride into town and was able to drop my bike off at [Revolution Bike & Boards](http://revolutionbandb.webs.com/) here in Charlevoix, MI. Holy crap were these guys cool. Not only were they open on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, but they also offered to try and look at it the same day, and get me back on the road.

I hung around Charlevoix for a few hours, when I got a call back from the owner, Chet, who said things were good to go. I got back over to the shop, and he explained that the hub on my current rear wheel had gotten a bit too much dirt and sand in it, and it was starting to wear away. A new rear wheel set me back about 80$, but I obviously didn't have much of a choice. Afterwards, I talked with Chet for a little bit about my trip and headed back south on 31 for about a mile to the place I was camping for the night.

So the other day, when I was picked up on the side of the road with my broken down bike, the guy who gave me the ride offered to let me camp on the property he owned behind his used car dealership here in Charlevoix.

It was about 5:00pm or so when I got back and was looking like there was going to be some rain coming, so I set up and napped a bit before heading out to try and find some power/wifi.

It rained quite a bit that night, and it kept me up at times with how loud it was, but it was a comfortable night nonetheless.

I woke up to a drizzly morning, but it was pretty warm out. I got packed up and started my way back up 31 towards Petoskey/Mackinac City.
