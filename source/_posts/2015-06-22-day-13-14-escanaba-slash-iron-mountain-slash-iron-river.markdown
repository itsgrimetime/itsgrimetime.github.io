So since I left Escanaba I have been staying with friends in Iron Mountain, Iron River, Houghton, and all down the coast of Lake Michigan (Wisconsin side).

On previous posts I was just putting the images directly in the post, which was bad because a lot of those pictures were huge (some of the panoramas are something like 10-12MB) Obviously this means when you open up the main page of the website, you have to load every single picture I've taken. On slow connections this could take forever, and it could be devastating if you don't have an unlimited data plan on your phone and loaded up the site on mobile. After trying to find some other templates and image gallery plugins I opted for just embedding the imgur album at the end of each post. I've
done this with all past posts as well.

I waited to long to start writing this so its going to be kind of hard to remember all the things that have happened since I last posted. My plan is to just post small chunks of the trip up until now.

Not a lot worth noting happened on the ride to Iron River. I got to see some of the cool old buildings, including the courthouse in Crystal Falls, and the large catholic church I used to live next to in Iron Mountain.
