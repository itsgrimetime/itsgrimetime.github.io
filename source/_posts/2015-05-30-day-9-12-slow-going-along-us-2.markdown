It's weird to think I've been in the UP for almost a week already. So far it's been pretty slow going along US-2, with lots of stop for rest and waiting out some rain.

When I left Straits State Park, right next to the bridge, I expected to make it close to Naubinway, at least. I don't know what it was, but riding was just really tiring that day, and I only made it to Brevort where I caved after having lunch and called it a day.

The next morning I felt pretty good, and was ready to make some real distance.

Unfortunately, I caught a bit of rain only a few minutes before I passed through Epoufette, and of course, I was optimistic and thought it would stop...

Well, it didn't I ended up riding in the rain for about another hour, before finally getting to the campground I had planned on getting to the previous day. I set up my hammock and rainfly and decided to wait things out and warm up a bit. I considered staying until the next morning to dry some of my stuff out since the forecast had mentioned sunny and 70, and everything I had was soaked through completely.

I napped for a bit and around 5ish the sun came back out, and it warmed up enough for me to feel alright wearing sandals on the bike while I strapped my soaking wet shoes onto the back to try and help them air dry.

It was a pretty nice ride the rest of the evening to Lake Milakokia, but holy crap were the mosquitos crazy. I woke up to half a dozen of them in my bugnet with me, and what had to be hundreds crawling around outside of it.

In Escanaba I ended up staying with a host from [Warm Showers](http://warmshowers.org), a couch-surfing type of site aimed towards cyclists.

I'll have more pictures soon!
