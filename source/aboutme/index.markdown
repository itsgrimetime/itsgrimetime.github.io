My name is Mike, and I just recently graduated from Michigan Technological University with my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I figured this is probably my last real summer break in the forseeable future, so I'm trying to make the most of it while seeing as much of my home state as possible before moving out west. If you're interested in contacting me, feel free to drop me a line at <magrimes@mtu.edu>.
