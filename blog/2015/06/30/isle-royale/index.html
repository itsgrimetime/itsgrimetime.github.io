<div class="entry-content"><p>My main reason for coming to Houghton, besides seeing Marvin and the Novak brothers, was to finally do a much-talked-about Isle Royale trip with Ethan. My second night in Houghton I headed over to Ethan&rsquo;s house and him, Leah, and I booked our tickets on the Ranger III, and purchased our park usage passes. Easy enough. We did a quick trip to Walmart that night and picked up our food and other last minute supplies for the (what we thought) was 5 days, and 4 nights on the island. Ethan introduced me to the 1$ camping miracles that are Rice Sides. These packets fit perfectly into a pint-sized
camp pot and take up way less room than the fancy Mountain House/Government Issued MRE&rsquo;s you can get. Plus they&rsquo;re like 10% of the cost. We loaded up on some other things too while being sure not to overpack and carry unnecessary food. We both have water filters so packing in water wasn&rsquo;t needed. The true camp-food MVP&rsquo;s ended up being the Rice Sides and instant oatmeal. Just add hot water and you have a very decent meal on the trail :). Some small bags of candy, trail mix, dried fruit a few boxes of Clif bars later and we were set up to eat like kings on the island.</p>

<p>We called the National Parks Service station where the Ranger III leaves from in Houghton the morning of to make sure all was still good - and were told that an unanticipated repair would be putting us back until 1pm. No big. Our hike to the first campsite is only 3 miles. We end up getting to the boat launch around 12:30 and end up hanging around until almost 2:30, when we finally board the boat.</p>

<p>The Ranger III is a pretty old boat - and started doing trips between Houghton and the isle in 1957 (If I remember correctly). It&rsquo;s a really nice ride out to the island, too. While it is a bit on the long side (5 and &frac12; hours or so), its really cool seeing Houghton and Hancock from the portage, and watching it disappear on the horizon as the island comes into view in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>It was pretty cold when we got there, and we only had a few hours left of sun, so we started moving quick towards our first campsite at Three Mile.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into too much detail about all the little things we did, because honestly, the setting up/cooking/getting to bed part of camping isn&rsquo;t very interesting, and it was essentially the same every night.</p>

<p>For those who have been to the island and are familiar with the locations, we ended up doing a really nice sized loop on the north/east side of the island. From Rock Harbor we went to Three Mile, Moskey Basin, McCargoe Cove, Daisy Farm, and spent our last night at Rock Harbor in order to catch the 9am boat out.</p>

<p>Now, if you were paying attention you might have noticed that I originally said we&rsquo;d be spending 4 nights and 5 days on the island. Well, thanks to Ethan and I&rsquo;s &ldquo;let&rsquo;s just wing it&rdquo; attitude (which has been heavily reinforced after an awesome semester studying abroad together in Seoul) we failed to noticed that the Ranger doesn&rsquo;t make the trip to the island every day, and in fact only departs each destination every other day. Whoops. So we ended up staying 5 nights, and 6 days on the island. Lucky for us we packed enough food to squeeze by on without anyone having to be too hungry at any point in the
trip.</p>

<p>Some highlights were staying at McCargoe Cove, which was a good bit warmer than Lake Superior, which Ethan and Leah had swam in on our first day on the island (there&rsquo;s no way it was above 36 degrees). Inside the cove wasn&rsquo;t too much warmer, perhaps mid 50&rsquo;s, so it was bareable long enough for you to dive in and quickly scramble your way out. I think McCargoe Cove was everyones favorite, as well.</p>

<p>We stopped at East Chickenbone and jumped in there too, since it started to heat up in the ladder half of our trip. This lake was actually really comfortable to swim in. Ethan and I stripped down and probably spent a good 5-10 minutes in it.</p>

<p>Daisy Farm was another really nice campground. On the night we stayed there, we had an extremely clear sky. Ethan woke me up at probably 1:30am or 2am and we went out and he took a couple shots of the sky. The timing of our trip with the moon cycles lined up really weird. Once it got dark it was extremely dark, as if there was a new moon, but after a few hours a really deep red glow would be visible off the eastern coast of the island, and slowly (relative to how the moon and sun usually seem to move it was actually really quick) the moon would rise. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything quite like it
before, and Ethan was able to grab quite a few really spectacular photos of it.</p>

<p>On our second to last day, we ended up seeing a Moose!</p>

<p>Obviously there was tons more, but I really don&rsquo;t feel like recalling it all and writing it down right now. You can alwasys just ask :)</p>

<p>Here are Ethan&rsquo;s flickr album photos (they&rsquo;re way better than mine):</p>
