<p>I dont remember a lot of this ride already, (its curretly day 3, time on the bike is starting to blend together in my head).</p>

<p>The Musketawa trail is a 25-mile paved trail that connects Marne and Muskegon, MI.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-g5ZVqG77LXs/VVt0GJjIh0I/AAAAAAAAF1Y/seshGABqhUw/w917-h688-no/IMG_0338.JPG' width='' height='' title='Looking north-west on the Musketawa Trail'><span class='caption-text'>Looking north-west on the Musketawa Trail</span></span></p>

<p>Overall it was a nice ride. It was really warm, which was great, but I was going into a ~15mph headwind most of the way when there wasn&rsquo;t tree cover. I was pretty beat by the end of the day.</p>

<p>The park I was at was almost empty, which was pretty cool.</p>

<p>What I thought was going to be a short ride (only ~35 miles compared to the ~45 I did the day before) turned out to be a much more frustrating and tiring day.</p>

<p>It was really cold, somewhere around 45 degrees, and again I was going into a really strong headwind. I was dumb and didn&rsquo;t pack much in terms of cold weather gear, so I was stuck pedaling with shorts and a long-sleeve tshirt for the first while.</p>

<p>Just before I got to Whitehall, I had my first flat. It took me a while to fix because of the cold, so I didn&rsquo;t even get into Whitehall/Montague until around 1:00pm.</p>

<p>On the way out of Whitehall I stopped at a clothing surplus store to grab an extra hoodie and sweatpants. I guarantee you - I look really cool now.</p>

<p>The extra layers helped a bit, but it was still cold riding. It felt like it took so much just to get myself to maintain a decent speed on the trail.</p>

<p>Silver Lake State Park was beautiful, and I was able to catch an awesome sunset over the dunes across Silver Lake. Those pictures will be up soon.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time doing this right now, as I&rsquo;m still ~25 miles away from Orchard Beach State Park and its almost 5:00pm already. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have internet and some time to work on this tomorrow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to take the set-up out for a trial-run at least once before embarking on the full trip. I&rsquo;ve taken it out fully loaded for two separate 20ish mile rides and it rode pretty well, but I wanted to see if there were any kinks in the whole ride-camp-ride process that needed to be worked out before leaving for the big ride.</p>

<p>I ended up deciding Newaygo State Park was a good distance (~40 miles). It also allowed me to ride a bit on both paved and dirt roads as well as paved and gravel trails.</p>

<p>Overall, the ride up wasn&rsquo;t bad. Riding on some of the county roads was a little scary at first, since people speed like crazy down them.</p>

<p>Departure is scheduled for Monday the 18th, and Muskegon State Park is the first destination (~48 miles). I&rsquo;m getting stoked!</p>

<p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s some random pictures from throughout the day (the popout isn&rsquo;t working, so if you want to see a bigger version of a picture just right click and &lsquo;Open Image in New Tab&rsquo;).</p>
